This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates a race condition. The program uses a dictionary to accumulate values, but this approach is not thread-safe. If multiple threads try to modify the dictionary simultaneously, there is no guarantee on the output. The bug is subtle and easily missed, highlighting the importance of thread-safe data structures when dealing with concurrency. A solution is provided that uses `defaultdict` from Python's `collections` module to mitigate the issue.
